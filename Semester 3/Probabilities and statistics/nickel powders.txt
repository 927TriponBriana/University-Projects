Nickel powders are used in coatings used tot shield electronic equipment.
A random sample is selected and the sizes of nickel particles in each coating are recorded.

x = [3.26 1.89 2.42 2.03 3.07 2.95 1.39 3.06 2.46 3.35 1.56 1.79 1.76 3.82 2.42 2.96];

a). At the 5% significance level, on average, do these nickel particles seem to be smaller than 3?

b). Find a 99% confidence interval for the standard deviation of the size of nickel particles.
